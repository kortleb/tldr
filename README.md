## Book Summaries

The density of original points in an average book tends to be pretty low. Distilling the book is thus a time intensive exercise. And I thought it would be useful to share the fruits of that labor. 

I would love to hear from you! If you have a suggestion about improving an existing summary, or want to contribute a summary, open a PR.
