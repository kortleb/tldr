## Everybody Lies

Caveat Lector. The book is generally hopelessly short on details about how numbers were generated. For instance, in sex::point_1, we don't know how it was deduced that the people searching were married, in what time frame research was conducted, etc.

### Sex

* Among married people: 'sexless marriage' --- top problem searched. 3x more searches than 'unhappy marriage' and 8x more than 'loveless marriage.'

* Among unmarried: 'sexless relationship' is 2nd most common after 'abusive relationship'

* In India, #1 search beginning w/ 'my husband wants ...' is 'to breastfeed him'
    - porn searches w/ women breastfeeding 4x common in India and Bangladesh than anywhere else in the world

* Women search for concerns around their genitals as much as men. Women's #1 search = whether their vagina smells.

* Banana Dreams 
    - Data from Shadow, app. on which users record dreams. Not sure what the data show except whether or not fruits/vegies shaped like a dick is not a predictor of how common it is in the dream after "controlling for popularity."
        - Key predictor of what food we dream off = what we consume. water is #1. top 20 include chicken, bread, sandwiches, rice
        - 2nd big predictor of what food we dream off = what we find tasty. #1 and #2 = chocolate and pizza
        - Bananas are #2 on dreams but also 2nd most commonly eaten fruit. cucumbers 7th most common on both lists. hot dogs dreamed < hamburgers
        - funny phrase: 'did not give it more likelihood' (explaining regression coef.)
    
* Incest:
    - 16 of top 100 searches by men on PornHub related to incest. Includes 'mom and son', 'mom fucks son', 'step mom fucks son', 'brother and sister', 'real brother and sister'.
    - 9 out of top 100 searches by women on PH around incest. Looking for 'dad and daughter' etc.
    - Google search, most common way to finish 'i want to have sex with my ...' = mom. 'I am attracted to ...' also has bunch of incest related stuff. But searches are not v. common. A few 1000s per year in the U.S.
        + Note: There is a very obtuse appendix table. Not clear what the numbers mean. Is it total n. searches? Then what is the time period? Number for mom given = 720.

* Baby
    - Data = wives searching about husbands on Google. Find = adult men want to wear diaper, be breastfed. Not clear how the data was collected. 
    - most frequent profession of women in porn videos searched by men who are 18-24; 25-64; 65+ = babysitters. teacher & cheerleader in top 4 for each group of men.

* Americans search for 'porn' more than they search for 'weather'. 
    - tried on google trends. pans out.

* Among 150 most common searches by men:
    - shemale (77th most common; 1.4% of searches), granny (110th). 

* 25% of female searches for straight porn emphasize pain/humiliation. 5% for non-consensual. And women search for all these terms 2x as often as men.

* 11% women between 15--34 say they are sexually active, !pregnant, !contraceptives. Should mean 10% become pregnant each month. 1 in 113 women become pregnant ----> not enough people having sex.
    - 16x more often to search for spouse not having sex than spouse willing to talk
    - 5.5x more likely for unmarried to complain about partner not wanting sex than not texting back
    - 2x more complaints that boyfriend won't have sex than girlfriend
        + boyfriend won't have sex = #1 searched complaint

* Men search for questions about penis more than any other body part
    - more searches for how to make penis bigger than how to tune a guitar, make an omelet, change a tire
    - top googled concern about steroids = size of penis
    - men search 170x more often about penis than women do about their partner's penis
    - 40% of women's searches about partner's penis size = it's too big.
    - women search as often about getting boyfriends to climax sooner as making it longer 

* 12% of non-generic porn searches about big boobs. 20x search volume of small boob porn

### Sexuality

* Kinney oversampled prisoners and prostitutes and estimated 10% of Americans are gay. Representative surveys estimate 2--3%.

* FB men --- 2.5% interested in men

* Surveys, FB suggest more gays in tolerant states than intolerant. RI (highest support for gay marriage) gay population ~ 2x Mississippi (lowest support for gay marriage)
    - Gay people move from intolerant to tolerant
    - Gay people hide that they are gay in intolerant states

* Assume HS students can't move to where they want to live. (Well their parents can choose to move.) So state diff. shouldn't appear in HS. Only 2 in 1000 boys in MS come out as gay.

* Using Search data and Adwords, 5% of male porn searchers for gay male porn --- 'rocket tube', 'gay porn'. more gay porn searches in tolerant than intolerant. In MS, 4.8% is for gay porn. In RI = 5.2%. Estimates 5% of men are gay in US. In CA Bay Area ~ 4% openly gay on FB (this number gotten from FB ads data.). 
    - 20% of videos watched by women on PornHub are lesbian.

* Most common way to finish 'Is my husband' = 'gay'. 10% more often than 'cheating'. gay is 8x more common than 'an alcoholic' and 10x more often than 'depressed'
    - is my husband gay more common in intolerant regions. highest in SC and LA

* Craigslist Ad data:
    - percentage men looking for casual encounters w/ men higher in less tolerant states. highest = KY, LA, AL

* Search for 'gay test' 2x more common in the 'least' tolerant states
    - people will search 'gay test' and then 'gay porn' or after

### Gender 

* According to AdWords:
    - interest in beauty and fitness = 42% male. 
    - Weight loss = 33% male
    - Cosmetic surgery = 39% male
    - 20% of searches of 'how to' about breasts = getting rid of man boobs

* 7M searches/yr for breast implants. 300K women get implants each year.
    - source unknown as Google Trends doesn't give #s

### Race 

* In the US, nigger(s) searched as often as migraine(s), economist, and Lakers
    - tried this on Google trends but shows diff. results (n word much less common). so not clear.
    - n-word in 7M American searches/year 
        + not clear how precise number gotten at. 
    - Rap lyrics weren't skewing the results. They use 'nigga(s)'
    - reason for search = looking for offensive jokes. 20% of searches included the word 'jokes.' other common phrases used in conjunction = stupid, 'i hate ...'
    - n... jokes 17x common than 'kike jokes', 'gook jokes', 'spic jokes', 'chink jokes', 'fag jokes' combined
    - search for 'n jokes' rises by 30% on MLK day

* Nate Silver: Best predictor of Trump support in primaries = searches for N word in the area

* Stormfront:
    - quantcast: 200--400k visits per month
    - 30% women
    - states w/ higher per capita members = Montana, Alaska, Idaho

* On Obama's election night
    - 1 in 100 searches included 'kkk' or 'nigger(s)'
    - search for Stormfront was 10x normal
    - in some states, searches for 'nigger president' > 'first black president'

* Estimates Obama lost 4% due to explicit racism
    - Regressing (Obama - Kerry) ~ searches for N word + ed 'levels' + age + church etc. 

* Place with highest search rates of 'nigger(s)' =
    - upstate NY, western PA, eastern OH, industrial MI, rural IL, WV, LA, MS

* Racist searches not correlated w/ unemployment

* Why are X people ... top 5 negative words ...
    - blacks: rude, racist, stupid, ugly, lazy
    - jews: evil, racist, ugly, cheap, greedy
    - muslims: evil, terrorists, bad, violent, dangerous
    - mexicans: racist, stupid, ugly, lazy, dumb
    - asians: ugly, racist, annoying, stupid, cheap
    - gays: evil, wrong, stupid, annoying, selfish
    - christians: stupid, crazy, dumb, delusional, wrong

* Top Google search w/ word Muslims in CA post San Bernardino = 'kill Muslims'. Americans searched for 'kill Muslims' as often as 'martini recipe', 'migraine symptoms'. Apparently also as often as 'Islamophobia'. hate searches about 20% of searches for Muslim before attack, 50% hours after it.

* In 2015, 12k searches in US for 'kill Muslims'. 12 Muslims victims of hate crime.

### Why Search Data is Great, Bad

* **Lying on surveys**
    - On surveys, heterosexual women report having sex 55x/year and using a condom 16% of the time. This ~ 1.1B condoms. Heterosexual men numbers yield estimate of 1.6B condoms/year. Nielsen reports total condom sales ~ 600M.
    - Unmarried men claim using condoms 29x/year. Net number > total condom sales in the US.

* People are trying to find out stuff they need. So they have to be honest.

* People won't search for stuff that they passively get via their apps. etc. For instance, weather info. 

* Google search data bias = toward negative, weird

* Relationship between n_searches, action can be weak. In 2015, 12k searches in US for 'kill Muslims'. 12 Muslims victims of hate crime.

### Validating Google Trend Data

**Not sure how this was deduced as trend data doesn't allow us to recover this.**

* States that search most for God = Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas
* God searched most often on Sunday
* Knicks searched most often in NYC

### Other Interesting Patterns in Google Searches

* search for 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxiety help' higher in places with lower levels of ed., lower median income, greater rural pop. Search rates higher in upstate NY than NYC
* anxiety related searches don't rise day after terror attacks (since 2004, all major European or American attacks)
* searches for jokes lowest on Mondays, cloudy or rainy days.
* In winter, warm climates have 40% fewer depression searches than cold climates. Most effective depression drug ~ 20% effect.
* Each month, 3.5M google searches related to suicide
    - Again not clear how number was arrived at. What the time period is etc.

* In Mexico, top search about 'my pregnant wife' include = 'words of live to my pregnant wife' and 'poems for my ...' US -> 'now what' and 'what do i do'

* Using Google Autocomplete, #1 way to finish 'is it normal to want to ...' = 'kill' and then #1 way to finish 'is it normal to want to kill...' = 'my family'

* In 2015, in US, 700k GOOG searches into self-induced abortions, 3.4M searches for abortion clinics. 4k searches for coat hanger abortions. Steady search rates between 2004--207. Increase in late 2008 with fin. crisis, and in 2011, jump 40%. 2011 is when crackdown against abortion started. 92 state provisions restricting abortion enacted. MS = state w/ highest search rate for self-induced abortion. 8 out of 10 states at top hostile to abortion (hostility ratings from Guttmacher).

* Sexism:
    - parents 2.5x 'is my son gifted' than 'is my daughter gifted'. same for 'is my son a genius'. apparently more searches for 'is my son behind' > 'is my daughter behind' but precise # not given
    - 'is my daughter overweight' 2x 'is my son overweight'. more eager to search for how to get their daughters to lose weight than boys. 
        - baseline = 28% of girls overweight vs. 35% of boys

* People 7x likelier to search if people will regret not having children than search if they will regret having children
    - precise numbers in appendix given for total searches of people saying they regret having children (1,730 per month) --- how were the numbers gotten? Google provides no obv. way to get these numbers. Aargh.  

### Other Stuff Google Searches Predict

* (Bing Search): Pancreatic Cancer: search for abdominal pain followed by yellowing skim --- can identify 5 to 15%

* 'flu symptoms' and 'muscle aches' ---> indicators of how fast flu is spreading.

* 'how to vote' and 'where to vote' predicts turnout

* Using Google correlate, when housing prices are rising, Americans search for '80/20 mortgage', 'new home builder' and 'appreciation rate'. When falling, search for 'short sale process', 'underwater mortgage' and 'mortgage forgiveness debt relief'.

* Using Google correlated, #1 correlated w/ unemployment rate (2004--2011) = 'slutload'. Another highly correlated term = 'spider solitaire'. 'rawtube' also highly correlated at 1 point. basic point = 'diversion related' searches track unemp. well.

* Vote pref.:
    - Person puts candidate they support first in a search that includes both cand. names w/ Stuart Gabriel (USC)
        - 1/4 of searches with Trump also included Clinton
        - includes some BS low N correlations

* Conventional Wisdom = Explicit racism is limited to small % of Americans, mostly in the deep south. 

### Misc. Research Reported

* Size of heart, esp. left ventricle, is #1 predictor of race horse success. Another big predictor = size of spleen (bigger, better). 2-year old horses that wheeze after running 1/8th of a mile nearly never pan out.

    - the person behind a good chunk of this = Jeff Seder

* Wine price ~ (Ashenfelter)
    - Wine price mostly explained by region
    - Wine quality ~ region + weather from year grown
        + Price = 12.145 + .00117 winter rainfall + .0614 avg. growing season temp. + .00386 harvest rainfall

* Using school picture books:
    - over time (1900s to 2010s), people, esp. women, started smiling in photos
    - Article = https://www.technologyreview.com/s/543871/data-mining-reveals-how-smiling-evolved-during-a-century-of-yearbook-photos/

* Basketball
    * black men are 40x white men to reach the NBA
    * black kid born in wealthiest county in US is 2x more likely than one born in the poorest
    * NBA superstars 30% less likely to be born to unwed mothers. Data = 100 NBA players born in 1980s who scored the most points.
    * Fryer and Levitt found, among African Americans, unwed mothers, uneducated etc. give kids more unusual names. AA Kids born to poverty have 2x the rate of having a unique name. CA born NBA players have 1/2 as likely unique names as avg. black male
    * 60% of AA born in 1980s were born to unwed mothers. Of the Black NBA players born in 1980s, majority born to married parents

* Top addictions reported to Google in 2016: Drugs, Sex, Sugar, Porn, Love, Gambling, Alcohol, FB

* Levitt used which team is in the finals as an instrument for ad exposure:
    - When Boston playing, Baltimore not (2012), respective audience shares in the cities = 56.7, 47.9. If reverse, shares = 48.0, 59.6 (2013)
    - Ad for movies ---> sig. more people attend movies advertised in the superbowl in cities whose teams make playoffs. no effect on movies not advertising in the superbowl
    - Hartmann and Klapper --- beer and soft drink --- 2.5x ROI

* Clemens and Gottlieb use data on how Medicare reimburses physicians for procedures --- change by county --- to estimate how motivated are docs. by fin. incentives --- 2% increase in payment leads to 3% increase in care provision: https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.104.4.1320 (elective procedures respond much more strongly.)  

* When people become fans of baseball teams:
    - Teams that win when they are 10 (normally distributed around that; age 10 = 8% of the fans, by 19 ~ 1%)

* When people get PID:
    - popular president in 14--24 shapes PID. Age 18 is most sig.
    - Gelman et al.

* Cheating on taxes:
    - EITC max. at income of $9k. So $9k is the most commonly reported taxable income reported by self-employed w/ 1 child. In Miami, 30% reported $9k. In PHL, 2%. Biggest predictor of cheating = network effects.
