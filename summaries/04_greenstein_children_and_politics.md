## Children and Politics by Fred Greenstein

### Chapter 1

* Alexis de Tocqueville, Vol. 1, Chapter 2 – Urges that we study humans starting early on – not as adults.

* Latency years: 9 to 13: not much happens during this time but children move from near complete ignorance of politics to some understanding of the most conspicuous features of adult political arena

* Napoleon urged training kids about politics. Soviet Union did a bunch of indoctrination. In the US, all but 4 states asked kids to be instructed in Constitution at the elementary school level

* What is learned?
  -  Three kinds of acquired orientations – cognitive knowledge, attitudes, and standards of evaluation about political leadership, ‘regime’ or form of government, and political community itself (Easton and Hess, 1961)
  -  Political motivation, values, norms, and information (Mitchell 1962)
  -  Latent (or analogous) (nonpolitical learning: personality development, cultural values) and manifest learning (explicit transmission of information, values, feelings vis-à-vis roles, inputs and outputs of political system).
  -  Citizen role (partisan attachment, ideology, motivation to participate), subject role (national loyalty, legitimacy of roles and institutions), recruitment to and performance of specialized roles

* Socialization: Who learns what from whom under what circumstances to what effects (Laswell)

### Chapter 3: Data are from New Haven; Children from 4th to 8th grade

* Adults are somewhat cynical about politics and politicians. Virtually no children are.

* No specific awareness of the political roles but children rate role of President and Mayor as ‘most important’. Reasoning: he is important, so he must do important things.

* Evaluations and ‘affective knowledge’ precedes factual information.  Structure of factual knowledge is erected on a foundation of feelings, assessments, and opinions.

* Declining trend in remarks about president doing good things.

### Chapter 4: Development of Political information and Partisan Motivations

* More important a political orientation is in the behavior of adults, the earlier it will be found to emerge in the learning of the child

* Learning about the mayor and the president greatest (final at 75%), followed by congress (62%), followed by governor (49%), state legislature (32%), and local alderman (19%) etc.

* Learning of executive branch precedes the legislature

* Think legislature is subordinate to executive

* Gap between knowledge of executive and legislature perhaps the greatest at the state and the local level.

* One model of vote choice: 1. Judgment on merits of candidates, 2. Assessment of issues raised in campaigns, 3. Standing choice (PID), 4. Some combination of the above

* Some observations about PID –
  -  Importance of PID: 50% identifiers vote the party in all elections, 5% of independents do the same.
  -  Ability of parties to command loyalty of bulk of voters prevents rise of new parties, and has huge impact on who has the power
  -  Stability of party in turn ‘causes’ parties to be highly visible and ‘available’ as basis of political choice

* Late arrival of issue orientations
  -  Any reference of issues or ideology weak (19%) at 6th grade. By 8th grade about 51% are able to make somewhat vague statements. Only 6% of the 8th graders are able to make the ‘more sophisticated’ statements made by adults.

* Early arrival of PID
  -  By 4th grade, 6 out of 10 children able to state their PID. Basically stays the same till 8th grade. Most state preferences same as their parents. Also attribute preferences to their parents.
  -  In France – far fewer children acquire PID from their parents (see Converse and Dupeux 1962).

* Causes and consequences of sequence of development
  -  What comes early considered more important. So executive comes before legislature. Even in mass culture, focus on presidency greater than congress. 
  -  Orientations most important in behavior of adults, form early.
  -  Early learning affects later learning.

### Chapter 5: Learning by SES

* Lower class children have more physical freedom while upper class more psychological freedom: parents take child’s opinion seriously, explain reasons etc. (Psathas 1957, 1949)

* Reference to issues when talking about parties among high SES vastly more than low SES

* No significant differences in rates of identifying with party

* Among high SES, people used PID to guide their approval ratings. Among low SES, it wasn’t the case.

* Formal education equalizes knowledge of formal aspects of government.

* Lower SES more likely to say leader doing a very good job.  

### Chapter 6: Learning by Gender

* Boys initially source their PIDs from father, girls from mother. Eventually both source from father at significantly greater levels than mother. 

* Fewer girls say they have PID than boys

### Chapter 7: Learning over the years

* Children in 58 far more likely to name non-serious entertainers as exemplars than say in 1902.
