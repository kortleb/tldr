## How Google Works

* Aims:
    - Go for really big targets: mapping all the streets, scanning all the books, etc.

* Values:
    - Focus on the user 
    - Constantly communicate and reinforce with rewards the key values.

* Innovation Strategy:
    - 70/20/10 rule: 70% core, 20% emerging, 10% new
    - Focus on big challenges, stuff that will affect hundreds of millions of people.
    - Focus on users
    - Don't look for empty spaces and be lonely
    - Innovation = production and implementation of novel and useful ideas
        + novel in that it is surprising
    - Market research can't get you to your next product:
        + Henry Ford: If I had listened to customers, I would have gone out looking for faster horses
    - Can't follow competition --- incremental, low impact changes
    - Talk to technical people
    - Focus on what people need
    - What will be true in five years
    - Pasteur's Quadrant:
        + basic science + real world problems
    - Look at criticism. Find what doesn't work, etc. Larry: 'these ads suck'
    - Learn to fail well:
        + Learn technical, user, market insights

* Investment Strategy:
    - Bet on technical insights
    - **What could be true in 5 years?**
    - Companies devote care and feed business that got them big. Not wise always. Internally GOOG allocated resources not just based on how big the prod. was, but how big it could be:
        + Bill Gates' Maxim: Spend 80% of the time on 80% of the revenue
    - Organize around people who can create and lead entire new ventures
    - Buffett: Looks for leaders who don't need him
    - From corp. perspective --- all innovative things look like small opportunities compared to large company. 
        + At indiv. level: people penalized for failure.
    - Job of CEO --- think of core business + about future

* Keys to a company:
    -  Products based on technical insights
    -  Product people on leadership team
    -  Reward and promote people with biggest impact
    -  Hiring a top priority for C-suite level with execs spending time on it

* Organization
     - Staying functionally organized but not by product. So engineering, products, finance ....  
     - If re-org., do reorg. quickly
     - Organize around people having highest impact
     - Each team = Bezos 2 pizza rule
     - Accountability
        + Keep them crowded
    - Encourage conversations
        + Keep them crowded but have spaces to go to
    - Product Managers work, eat, live with engineers
    - If we have data, let's look at the data. Jim Barksdale. CEO, Netscape
    - Old school
        + HiPPos: Highest paid person opinion
    - Rule of 7:
        + Each manager should have at least 7 people directly reporting

    - Know the details: what issues, what deliverables
    - snippets --- important activities for a week. Shared with everyone.
    - Open Q/A session at TGIF
        + Climb (get out of danger), Confess (confess), and comply
    - Communication

        + Make it effective, fun, interesting, inspirational
        + Authentic
        + Right people
        + Right medium
        + Tell the truth, be humble

    - Email
        - Respond quickly, crisply, clean out your inbox constantly
        - handle email in LIFO
        - remember you are a router
        - bcc only to get people out of an email loop
        - If you need to yell, yell in person
        - When you send a note to someone with action item you want to track, copy yourself then label follow-up
            + just resend w/ new intro: is this done

* Management
    - Make sure you would work for yourself
    - Write your own performance review once a year

* Process
    - Spend 80% of time on 80% of revenue (Bill Gates)
    - Bias for action (Tom Peters)
        + hands on, trial-and-error
    - Promote transparency:
        + open up everyone's calendars
        + hold more company wide meetings + q/a w/o reprisal
    - Roofshots + Moonshots
    - Moonshots:
        + Make things 10x better not just 10%
    - Roofshots
        + Luiz Barroso --- methodical, relentless pursuit of 1.3--2X opportunities.

* Meetings:
    - CEO Staff meeting: 50% of people should be experts in company's products and services and responsible for prod. dev.
    - Beware of bobblehead yes (Novell nod)
        + Agree in meeting, criticize later
    - Get quiet people to talk
    - Eric Schmidt method:
        + Identify the issue, have the argument, **set a deadline**
        + For important issues, meet everyday
    - Throw out stupid softballs
    - Right decision = best decision
        - Coach Wooden: be interested in finding the best way, not your way
    - Strategy Meeting:
        + Slides kill innovation. Get input from everyone
        + Articulate a rough time frame and end point you want to achieve
    - End meetings with 'you are both right,...'
    - Good meeting features
        + Meetings should have a single decision-maker/owner
            * Include senior as decision-maker
        + Decision maker should be hands on
        + Even brain storming sessions should have a clear owner
        + Meetings should be easy to kill
        + Manageable size: no more than 8 people. 10 max.
        + Attendance not important: if you are not needed, leave early.
        + Timekeeping matters: begin on time, end on time. Leave enough time for summarizing and action items
        + If you attend the meeting, attend the meeting
    - 1 on 1s:
        + Manager write down list of top 5 things, Employee does the same. And hopefully there is a lot of overlap
            + Performance
                + Sales Figs
                + Prod. delivery/milestones
            + Prod. and Eng.
            + Marketing and Product
            + Management
            + Innovation

* Partnerships
    - Be aggressively generous with partners in revenue sharing as it will eventually benefit the company.
