## Influence (Revised Edition) by Bob Cialdini

6 broad principles behind getting people to 'mindlessly' (without thinking) agree to your request (what Bob calls 'compliance'): consistency, reciprocation, social proof, authority, liking, and scarcity. Important unsaid rule = material self-interest: people want to get the most bang for the buck.


### Automatic Behaviors

* Fixed Action Patterns/Blindly Mechanical Patterns of Action
  - Example: Mother turkeys respond to cheep cheep sound by young turkeys. Experiment by M. W. Fox: polecat is a natural enemy and turkeys will attack a puppet of it. but if a tape recorder in the puppet plays cheep cheep, turkeys will take it under care. 
  - Photuris females flash mating signals of Photinus firefly  to eat them
  - **Difference between *trigger* and *actual threat*.** Turkeys aren't responding to actual threats, they are responding to triggers.
  - Parallel form of automatic response in humans = **people will be more likely to grant you a favor if you provide a reason.** (Research by Ellen Langer.) 
    - "Excuse me, I have 5 pages. May I use the Xerox machine?" (**60%** comply, which is also notable.)
    - "Excuse me, I have 5 pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I am in a rush?" (**94%** comply.)
    - "Excuse me, I have 5 pages. May I use the Xerox machine **because I have to make some copies**?" (**93%** comply.)
  - Another example: stereotype: expensive = better. Increasing price may increase sales. Ad by Dansk: 'Expensive by design.'
  - Related wisdom: 'civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking' (Alfred Whitehead)

### Contrast Principle

  * If two items presented in order, and if second is different from first, second's absolute value on commensurate trait will seem larger: 
      * If you pick a light object and then a heavy one, the weight of 2nd object seems heavier than when lifted first
      * Less satisfied with our looks because of looks of good looking people in media
          * People rated others less attractive if they saw ads in popular magazine first
          * Men in dorms rated looks of blind dates rated them lower if watching Charlie's angels
      * One hand in hot water, one in cold, then move both to lukewarm water. Hand moving from cold to lukewarm will register as warm, and hand moving from hot to lukewarm will send the signal that it is cold. Same pail of water, two different interpretations.
      * Application: 
          * Clothiers sell expensive stuff first. If you have bought a suit for \$495, a \$95 sweater doesn't seem expensive.
              * Whitney, Hubin and Murphy --- avg. price of accessories greater is bought after the suit than before.
          * Real estate companies: **setup properties** or run down properties at inflated prices maintained by the company. Show those to customers first.
          * Automobile: sell the base car before talking about one option or another

### Reciprocation + Contrast

  * If someone does a favor, you will feel obliged to return the favor
      * No human society that doesn't ascribe to the reciprocation rule (Alvin Gouldner)
      * Experiment by Dennis Regan:
          * Subject rates quality of painting. Confederate does a small favor for the subject (bring a coke --- I asked the experimenter if I could get a coke so I brought one for you also) half the time. Post-experiment, the confederate asks for a favor from the subject: buy some raffle tickets. 
              * 2x tickets sold when the confederate does a favor. 
              * How much subjects liked the confederate affected how many tickets they bought in control but not in favor condition.
              * Can cause unfair exchanges: coke = 10 cents. Raffle tickets = 25 cents. On average people bought 2 if given coke.
      * Applications: 
          * Hare Krishna/Hare Rama: Give people a 'gift' (Gita/Back to Godhead/flower) to the passerby. Don't take it back. 
          * Working for political donors can sometimes be an act of reciprocity, less about strategy
          * Free sample. Disabled Veterans org. reports simple mail appeal = 18%, if you include gummed, address labels etc. = 35%
  * Ask for something big, then smaller (what you originally wanted) (Calls it *Rejection then Retreat* strategy)
      * Boy sells $5 tickets, and then when you say no, suggests buying \$1 candy: 
        * Concession from him causes concession from you
        * Contrast principle also applies as the next demand is seen as more modest:
        * The more expansive demand is irrelevant information. But it changes your preferences.
    * Ask students to do a big pro-social thing and then asked for a smaller one. Compliance rate tripled.
    * Adding lines in the script that the censor is sure to ax so they they would negotiate what they wanted to include (Grant Tinker and Gary Marshall)
    * Liddy in Watergate had proposed more ambitious ideas before the break in idea was approved
    * Show customer the deluxe model first
    * Reject then retreat not only causes people to agree to the request but also more likely to carry it out.
    * Reject then retreat also works in behavioral games --- people walk away with more money.
      * **People think that their resistance/tactics causing others to concede** 
      * People also walk away most satisfied when opponent conceded some ground
    * How to say no?
      * Not accept the initial gift
      * Think of initial gift as a sales device rather than a gift

### Commitment and Consistency

  * Once a stand has been taken, pressure to be consistent

      * People more confident of horse winning just after buying the ticket than just before it

  * Public commitment more effective

  * Evidence
    - â€‹
    - Tony Greenwald: Vote after pledging
    - Freedman and Fraser: small sign then big sign
    - Natural gas saving + newspaper publicity (offer was later retracted)
      - people continued to save

    Examples:
    	- Chinese, POWs and asking to write essays
    - Scams	
      - How are you feeling (Good) - then ask about hunger relief.
      - Hazing rituals in fraternities
      - Low-ball offer: you get a great deal, commit, but later there is some error, revise upwards but you are still willing to buy
      - The con about toys -
        - Advertise a seductive toy around holidays
        - Under supply it during the holiday season
        - Parents agree to buy hot toy but can't buy it as sold out
        - Buy something else
        - Post holiday season - they buy the hot toy
        - Boys and Toys (Freedman)
      - Don't play with this fancy toy, don't play with non-fancy toys

### Social Proof

  * Examples
    - Laughter tracks (Smyth and Fuller )
    - Sorrows of Young Werther and Suicides
    - Paris opera houses and people paid to applaud: claquers

    - Bandura (1967) 
      - Dog phobia treatment
      - Show kids another person playing with a dog 

    - Bystander
      - Pluralistic ignorance: If bystanders aren't doing something - maybe it is not that important
      - Bibb Latane and Darley, Genovese case
      - What to do -
        - Be specific in request
        - Make the request to particular people
        - Social proof will eventually work for you as people see other people helping

    - Proof my people similar to you more persuasive

### Liking

  * Happier to heed to requests of those we like 
  * Attractive people are more liked
    - Canadian Voters
    - Courts
    - Resumes

  * Conditioning and Association
    - Endorse more statements shown when eating
    - Pavlov 
    - Beautiful women and cars
    - The person who brings bad news (weather man) criticized

### Authority

  * Milgram
  * People in business suits and jay walking
  * Nurses given bad directions by doctors follow it

  * Trustworthiness
    - Show good faith by saying something that isn't in your interests. even something small
    - assure people of fair mindedness

### Scarcity

  * Deadline technique
  * Sold out - let me go to the backroom
  * Toys within and without reach

  * Sherif:
    - Separate boys into residences creates us vs. they
    - more pronounced when names given: eagles and rangers
    - more pronounced when competition 
    - less so when cooperation
