## Influence by Bob Cialdini

### Reacting only to one highly salient aspect
	- mother turkey responds to cheep cheep sound by young turkeys. Exp. by M. W. Fox: polecat is a natural enemy and turkeys will attack a puppet of it. but if a tape recorder in the puppet plays cheep cheep, turkeys will take it under care. 
	
### Contrast Principle
	Examples:
	- If you have bought a suit for $495, a $49 sweater doesn't seem expensive
	- One hand in hot water, one in cold, then move both to lukewarm water. One will give the signal that it is hot, another that it is cold

### Reciprocation
	 - Do a small favor. Ask for a bigger favor.
	 - Rejection then retreat: 
		- You accept that your initial demand was unreasonable
		- So people feel obliged to grant your next demand
		- Also contrast: next demand is seen as more modest
			- Boy selling $5 X, then says buy candy
			- Show more expensive stuff first in the shop
	- The more expansive demand is irrelevant information. Doing that changes your preferences.

### Commitment and Consistency
	- Public commitment more effective
	- Evidence
		- Horse race: p(win) before and after buying the ticket
		- Tony Greenwald: Vote after pledging
		- Freedman and Fraser: small sign then big sign
		- Natural gas saving + newspaper publicity (offer was later retracted)
			- people continued to save
		
	Examples -
		- Chinese, POWs and asking to write essays
	- Scams	
		- How are you feeling (Good) - then ask about hunger relief.
		- Hazing rituals in fraternities
		- Low-ball offer: you get a great deal, commit, but later there is some error, revise upwards but you are still willing to buy
		- The con about toys -
			- Advertise a seductive toy around holidays
			- Under supply it during the holiday season
			- Parents agree to buy hot toy but can't buy it as sold out
			- Buy something else
			- Post holiday season - they buy the hot toy
			- Boys and Toys (Freedman)
		- Don't play with this fancy toy, don't play with non-fancy toys
	
### Social Proof

	- Examples -
		- Laughter tracks (Smyth and Fuller )
		- Sorrows of Young Werther and Suicides
		- Paris opera houses and people paid to applaud: claquers
		
	- Bandura (1967) 
		- Dog phobia treatment
		- Show kids another person playing with a dog 
	
	- Bystander
		- Pluralistic ignorance: If bystanders aren't doing something - maybe it is not that important
		- Bibb Latane and Darley, Genovese case
		- What to do -
			- Be specific in request
			- Make the request to particular people
			- Social proof will eventually work for you as people see other people helping
	
	- Proof my people similar to you more persuasive

	- Nurses given bad directions by doctors follow it
	
	- Trustworthiness -
		- Show good faith by saying something that isn't in your interests. even something small
		- assure people of fair mindedness
		
### Scarcity
